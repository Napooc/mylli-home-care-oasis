# Security Configuration

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. XSS Protection
- **DOMPurify Integration**: All HTML content is sanitized using DOMPurify before rendering
- **Safe HTML Renderer**: Custom component replaces `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with sanitized version
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers prevent script injection

### 2. Security Headers
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Browser XSS filter enabled
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Forces HTTPS connections
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information leakage

### 3. File Protection
- Sensitive files (.env, .log, .md) are blocked from direct access
- Configuration files are protected from public access
- Hotlinking protection for images

### 4. Build Security
- Console logs removed in production builds
- Source maps disabled for production
- Code minification and compression enabled

## Security Checklist for Deployment

### Before Deployment:
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are properly set
- [ ] Ensure HTTPS is configured on the server
- [ ] Test CSP headers don't break functionality
- [ ] Verify file permissions are correctly set
- [ ] Check that sensitive files are not accessible

### Regular Security Maintenance:
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated (run `npm audit` regularly)
- [ ] Monitor for security vulnerabilities in packages
- [ ] Review and update CSP headers as needed
- [ ] Test security headers using online security scanners

## Security Testing Tools

### Recommended Tools:
1. **Mozilla Observatory**: https://observatory.mozilla.org/
2. **Security Headers**: https://securityheaders.com/
3. **OWASP ZAP**: For comprehensive security testing
4. **npm audit**: For dependency vulnerability scanning

### Testing Commands:
```bash
# Check for vulnerable dependencies
npm audit

# Fix automatically fixable vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Check bundle size and security
npm run build
```

## Incident Response

In case of security issues:
1. Immediately assess the scope of the vulnerability
2. Apply emergency patches if available
3. Notify users if personal data is affected
4. Document the incident and lessons learned
5. Update security measures to prevent similar issues
